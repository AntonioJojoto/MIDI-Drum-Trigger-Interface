# Low-Cost MIDI Drum Trigger Interface

Many people may not know this, but drums are expensive, and if you live in an apartment, you can't just buy a cheap acoustic set and play, as your neighbors will call the police before you can finish playing your first song because an acoustic set can easily reach +110 dB.

However, there is another option, electronic drums. They are so silent that your roommates won't even complain (if you play at 3AM they might). But there is one **big** drawback to edrums, they are **too expensive**.

A low-tier edrum can go around 400€, I currently own a Yamaha DTX450k and I got a deal for it at 440€, as it normally goes for 550€ and when I was staring to practice it was OK, but then I got the chance to practice for a year on a acoustic set, and when I had to return to my cheap set I started to 

Here are some problems that you may encounter when you play a cheap electronic set:
- The sounds from the module are awful, specially the cymbals.
- The pads are tiny and hard, in my Yamaha Drumset, they are 8 inches wide.
- All the pads and cymbals are single-zone, so no rimshot, bell sound or anything else.
- Hihat pedal is only in open or closed position, you can't get a lot of sounds from it.
- In my case, as I like to play hard, the drum rack was moving a lot. The snare is always falling.

Sure, all of these problems may disappear as you upgrade to a more expensive drum set, but you will have to spend around 1200€. But even then, it will still be a mid-tier electronic drumset.
